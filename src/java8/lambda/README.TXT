Why Lambda?

1. Enable functional programming
2. Readable and concise code
3. Easier to use APIs and libraries
4. Enable support for parallel processing


Functional Interface:
    -> Exactly one abstract method
    -> annotate with @FunctionInterface
    -> If we add another method Java compiler will complain.
    -> Runnable is functional interface
    -> java.util.function -> Java comes with out of Box interface to be used in different cases.
